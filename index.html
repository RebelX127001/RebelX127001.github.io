			<h2>1997</h2>
			<p>On the fall of an amazing sunday, after much struggle and race to push out the final product, he who would be tagged the Rebel NeXtdoor was deployed!</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2011</h2>
			<p>Not taking it seriously, I found CMD, then DOS and typed my first command to impress my friends "color a && tree" (what I now call programming and will end up doing for the rest of my life).</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2013</h2>
			<p>Wanting to become an hacker and trying to escalate my privileges on the computers in the computer lab, I downloaded countless bat scripts from the internet that claim to do just that, they didn't work, but I became familiar with scripting, and since I had limited resources and knowledge to write mine or perhaps manipulate the scripts enough to get them working, I lost interest.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2014</h2>
			<p>I became a book-worm preparing for my WASSCE. I also won a MOK award in Computer Science as the best student in senior high school.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2015</h2>
			<p>I got really familiar with bash and wrote my first linux script to automate the navigation to and diring of my frequently visited directories while using a VM technology.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2016</h2>
			<p>By now, I already realized you can do almost everything you do in bash using CMD and it's even readily available on Windows without the need for virtual environments and so I jumped right back at CMD and while getting familiar with batch scripting, I wrote my first set of bat scripts, some of which were meant to play my favorite video playlist, reveal WiFi passwords and corrupt files.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2017</h2>
			<p>I got introduced to Blockchain, IOT, C++ and Python. The idea of security began to intrigue me as I thought, "could security be an illusion?". I delved deeper into ethical hacking and SE, wrote a security suite to; hide and encrypt files or shred sensitive files, built an app that uses ADB to manipulate an Android device, wirelessly. First as a batch script, then as a python project with a UI. Fell in love... with python.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2018</h2>
			<p>I furthered my research on IOT engineering and upon completion, I built a motion enabled lighting system. During the search, I came across an article on Bitcoin and as part of the first set of people to invest in Nigeria back in 2017, I made over 200% on my initial investment on BTC.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2019</h2>
			<p>I cashed out on bitcoin. Took a course on digital marketing and mini importation, Co-founded Ehub247 Ng which is an e-commerce solution for Africans and also an online directory where we help Nigerians handle technical and security related problems. Earned the following titles "Tech genius, Geek, Best Programmer".</p>

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2020</h2>
			<p>During the Covid-19 outbreak, I read and re-read great books. Books like; The $100 Startup, Think and Grow Rich, The Art of War, Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad and Cash Flow Quandrant, 48Laws, The Richest Man in Babylon etc. In all, I learnt a great deal about focus, consistency and patience.</p>
		</li> <!-- cd-service -->

		<li class="cd-service cd-service--1 js-cd-service">
			<h2>2021</h2>
			<p>Trying to stay alive, learning, building myself and perfecting my codes and projects. Made over 477% in Btc. Cashed out on the 4th of January. Balled and donated most to the endSars movement.</p>
